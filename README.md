# Mix-ILP-and-Deep-Graph-Matching
This repository contains a deep graph matching model pipeline implemented by Pytorch and Gurobi.

It also contains the configuration files to reproduce the experiment results in follow three benchmark datasets:
- PascalVOC Using keypoint-intersection filtering and unfiltered keypoints.
- Willow Pre-training on PascalVOC and fine tuning on Willow can be controlled separately.
- SPair-71k With the default intersection keypoint filetering.
